                Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory
                than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 4,500 years ago and is believed to be the
                oldest board game continuously played to the present day.
            </p>

            <p>
                The players take turns placing their stones on the vacant intersections (points) on the board. Once
                placed, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones)
                is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group
                is captured.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting the number of stones that the player has on
                the board, plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player's stones. If there is
                disagreement about which stones are 'dead', then the players simply resume play to resolve the matter.
                The score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively—The higher
                score wins.

                Aside from the order of play alternating moves, Black moves first and scoring rules, there are
                essentially only two rules in Go:
                <li>
                    Rule 1 (the rule of liberty) states that every stone remaining on the board must have at least one
                    open point (a liberty) directly orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right), or must be part of
                    a connected group that has at least one such open point (liberty) next to it. Stones or groups of
                    stones which lose their last liberty are removed from the board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rule 2 (the ko rule) states that the stones on the board must never repeat a previous position of
                    stones. Moves which would do so are forbidden, and thus only moves elsewhere on the board are
                    permitted that turn.
                </li>
            </p>

                Millennia ago, the great general Sun Zhu penned his magnum opus—<i>the Art of War</i>. Encapsulated
                within its pages were the greatest strategic insights ever written. Battles, once blood-soaked and won
                by sword, are now are waged in the mind. Embark on a journey into the realm of war's ultimate classic—<i
                    >Go</i
                >
                and unveil the truth: 'know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred
                battles'. With each stone you place, you'll shape the battlefield, carve out territory, and outmaneuver
                your opponents. Will you conquer, or will you become forgotten history?
